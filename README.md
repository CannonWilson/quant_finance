In this repository, I will implement 
some of the material in the book 
'Paul Wilmott Introduces
Quantitative Finance' as a means 
to practice my programming skills 
and sharpen my knowledge of
quantitative finance. 
I hope that, in the future, 
this repo will serve as a 
valuable reference to myself 
and potentially others.

The code in this repo is entirely 
my own, except where indicated 
in the comments. Credit for the
concepts explored here belongs
to Paul Wilmott [wilmott.com](https://wilmott.com/).
Note that I will usually not 
provide in-depth explanations 
of each topic, just their 
implementation.
